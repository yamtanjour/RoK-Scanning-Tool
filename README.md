# RoK-Scanning-Tool

Hey there! This is a Python tool I built to scan and analyze data from *Rise of Kingdoms* using LD Player. Basically, it grabs in-game screenshots, reads the text with OCR, and tracks the stats of players in the kingdom.

## What It Does

- **Screen Capture:** Automatically takes screenshots of your game.
- **OCR Magic:** Uses OCR to pull out text (Names, Power, KP, etc) from those screenshots.
- **ADB Integration:** Talks to LD Player using ADB commands so everything works together.
- **Debug Tools:** Includes some debug images so you can see exactly whatâ€™s being captured.
